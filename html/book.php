The premise behind make is simple: after you change source files and want to rebuild your program or other output files, make checks timestamps to see what has changed and rebuilds just what you need, without wasting time rebuilding other files. But on top of this simple principle, make layers a rich collection of options that lets you manipulate multiple directories, build different versions of programs for different platforms, and customize your builds in other ways.','author' => 'Robert Mecklenburg','year' => '2004','image' => 'http://s.it-ebooks-api.info/3/managing_projects_with_gnu_make_3rd_edition.jpg','subject' => 'linux'),
